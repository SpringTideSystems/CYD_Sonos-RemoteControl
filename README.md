If you are using your Sonos as an internet radio, you mght be interested in this project

Sonos speakers have a power and volume buttons only. There are no buttons for pre-selected redio stations as a 'normal' radio has. You always need the app on your mobile. If you are using other stations than your preferred station not often, you have a good chance, that you first have to update your sonos app, before chosing you radio station.

This project is setting a Sunton 2.8" 240*320 Display (ESP32-2432S028R) aka CYD (Cheap Yellow Display) into a remote control for your sonos speakers:
- Chosing the speaker, you want to control
- Chose one of your favorite radio stations
- power on/off
- set volume

Unfortunately, up to now, I was not able to retrieve the current running station from the speaker using the sonos library. I am happpy about any hint, how to do that.

Planned for future versions:
- Store configuration (SSID, password, Sonos IPs, Radio Stations) on a config file on the SD-Card of the CYD
